    small trees for augmenting skills
        each character has own tree for each skill
        skill stones used to unlock/upgrade nodes on tree once skill is unlocked
    excess skill stones can be converted to blanks then to other skills, or sold for gold

        might make starting a new character feel too fast if available right away
    alternatively
        high exp dungeon with dangerous enemies? and no other rewards

hidden clickables in dungeons
    would give small rewards like extra damage or gold found
    rewards could be zone specific, find each zone's set of clickables
        create special conditions for specific ones to spawn
            1 hero, fully upgraded gear of at least same tier
